You are solving an analogy problem. An analogy is a comparison between two things that are similar in some way. 
Your task is to complete the analogy by finding the relationship between the first two terms and applying that same relationship to find what the third term relates to.

Follow these steps to solve the analogy:
1. First, identify the specific relationship between the first two terms (A and B). Think about how A relates to B.
2. Next, apply this same relationship to the third term (C) to determine what the fourth term should be.
3. Finally, examine each of the given options and select the one that best completes the analogy based on the relationship you identified.

For each step, think carefully and consider multiple possible relationships before deciding. Be explicit in your reasoning.

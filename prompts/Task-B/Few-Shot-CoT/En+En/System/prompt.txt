You are solving an analogy problem. An analogy is a comparison between two things that are similar in some way. 
Your task is to complete the analogy by finding the relationship between the first two terms and applying that same relationship to find what the third term relates to.

Follow these steps to solve the analogy:
1. First, identify the specific relationship between the first two terms (A and B). Think about how A relates to B.
2. Next, apply this same relationship to the third term (C) to determine what the fourth term should be.
3. Finally, examine each of the given options and select the one that best completes the analogy based on the relationship you identified.

For each step, think carefully and consider multiple possible relationships before deciding. Be explicit in your reasoning.

Present your final answer in the format: ###Final Answer: (X) option_text

Here are some examples:

Example 1:
Complete the analogy: गंगा : नदी :: हिमालय : ?
(A) पर्वत
(B) देश
(C) महासागर
(D) मैदान

Step 1: First, I need to identify the specific relationship between "गंगा" (Ganga) and "नदी" (river). Ganga is a specific river, and "नदी" is its category or classification. This is a relationship where the first term is a specific example of the second term.

Step 2: Next, I need to apply this same relationship to "हिमालय" (Himalaya). If Himalaya is a specific example like Ganga, then I need to find its category or classification.

Step 3: Finally, let me examine each option:
- पर्वत (mountain): Himalaya is a specific mountain range, and "पर्वत" is the category "mountain." This follows the same pattern as Ganga and river.
- देश (country): Himalaya is not a country; it's a geographical feature.
- महासागर (ocean): Himalaya is not related to water bodies like oceans.
- मैदान (plain): Himalaya is the opposite of a plain; it's an elevated landform.

###Final Answer: (A) पर्वत

Example 2:
Complete the analogy: चावल : खेती :: लोहा : ?
(A) धातु
(B) खनन
(C) निर्माण
(D) व्यापार

Step 1: First, I need to identify the specific relationship between "चावल" (rice) and "खेती" (farming). Rice is an agricultural product that is obtained through the process of farming. This is a relationship between a product and the process used to obtain it.

Step 2: Next, I need to apply this same relationship to "लोहा" (iron). If iron is a product like rice, then I need to find the process used to obtain iron.

Step 3: Finally, let me examine each option:
- धातु (metal): This describes what iron is (a metal), not how it's obtained.
- खनन (mining): Mining is the process by which iron is obtained from the earth, just as farming is how rice is obtained. This maintains the same relationship.
- निर्माण (construction): This is a process that uses iron, not how iron is obtained.
- व्यापार (trade): This relates to distribution of iron, not its production.

###Final Answer: (B) खनन

Example 3:
Complete the analogy: दिल्ली : भारत :: टोक्यो : ?
(A) चीन
(B) रूस
(C) जापान
(D) कोरिया

Step 1: First, I need to identify the specific relationship between "दिल्ली" (Delhi) and "भारत" (India). Delhi is the capital city of India. This is a relationship between a capital city and its country.

Step 2: Next, I need to apply this same relationship to "टोक्यो" (Tokyo). If Tokyo is a capital city like Delhi, then I need to find the country of which Tokyo is the capital.

Step 3: Finally, let me examine each option:
- चीन (China): The capital of China is Beijing, not Tokyo.
- रूस (Russia): The capital of Russia is Moscow, not Tokyo.
- जापान (Japan): Tokyo is the capital of Japan. This maintains the same relationship as Delhi and India.
- कोरिया (Korea): The capitals of Korea (North or South) are Pyongyang or Seoul, not Tokyo.

###Final Answer: (C) जापान

Example 4:
Complete the analogy: पेंसिल : लिखना :: कैंची : ?
(A) पेपर
(B) काटना
(C) बनाना
(D) सीना

Step 1: First, I need to identify the specific relationship between "पेंसिल" (pencil) and "लिखना" (writing). A pencil is a tool used for the action of writing. This is a relationship between a tool and its primary function.

Step 2: Next, I need to apply this same relationship to "कैंची" (scissors). If scissors is a tool like a pencil, then I need to find its primary function.

Step 3: Finally, let me examine each option:
- पेपर (paper): Paper is an object that is worked upon, not an action.
- काटना (cutting): Cutting is the primary action for which scissors are used, just as writing is the primary function of a pencil.
- बनाना (making/creating): Making is not the primary function of scissors.
- सीना (sewing): Sewing typically uses needle and thread, not scissors.

###Final Answer: (B) काटना

Example 5:
Complete the analogy: शेर : जंगल :: मछली : ?
(A) पिंजरा
(B) समुद्र
(C) रेगिस्तान
(D) खेत

Step 1: First, I need to identify the specific relationship between "शेर" (lion) and "जंगल" (jungle/forest). A jungle is the natural habitat or environment where lions live. This is a relationship between an animal and its natural habitat.

Step 2: Next, I need to apply this same relationship to "मछली" (fish). If fish is an animal like a lion, then I need to find its natural habitat.

Step 3: Finally, let me examine each option:
- पिंजरा (cage): A cage is an artificial environment where animals are kept, not the natural habitat for fish.
- समुद्र (sea/ocean): The sea/ocean is the natural aquatic environment where most fish live, just as the jungle is the natural habitat for lions.
- रेगिस्तान (desert): A desert is a dry environment that is not suitable for fish.
- खेत (field/farm): A field is agricultural land and not the natural habitat for fish.

###Final Answer: (B) समुद्र
